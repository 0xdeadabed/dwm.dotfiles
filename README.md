# A collection of my dwm dotfiles.

### Hello friends, since I'm studying C programming language at [42Lausanne](https://www.42lausanne.ch/), I decided to switch my desktop manager from i3 to dwm, for some reasons but especially because it's written in C and I can laern even more. So I decided to write my notes in the form of tutorial and walkthrough.

#### Updates will come contiously.
