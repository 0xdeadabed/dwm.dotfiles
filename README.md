# A collection of my dwm dotfiles.

### Hello friends, since I'm studying C programming language at [42Lausanne](https://www.42lausanne.ch/), I decided to switch my desktop manager from i3 to dwm, for some reasons but especially because it's written in C and I can laern even more. So I decided to write my notes in the form of tutorial and walkthrough.

``Please note that these notes and dwm in general are aimed for more advanced users, especially you need some basic C theories to fully understand what I'm going to be talking about. Fore begginer users who wish to have a tiling windows manager, it's preferable to use windows managers like i3 for which I'll later create another repository where I'm going to be sharing my notes about it.``

#### Updates will come contiously.
